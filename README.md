Rural Measure Project Data and Code

The Rural Measures project uses a small device known as a QT (Quantitative Throughput) to accurately test and report broadband speeds from the user perspective. The project seeks to independently report on the rural-urban digital divide by utilizing both the QT and a matched user survey.
